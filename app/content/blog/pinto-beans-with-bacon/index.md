1. Soak beans (the night before)

Rinse the beans under cold water. Drain and add to a large container.
Cover with water, twice the volume of the beans. Season with 1-2 teaspoons salt.

2. Cook the bacon

Cut the bacon into 1 inch by 1 inch pieces. Add to a heavy-bottomed large pot.  Allow to sizzle until cooked and brown. Drain.  

3. Sautee the shallot

Add the shallot to the pan with the bacon grease and drippings. Sautee briefly,
then add the beans, cumin and chili powder. Stir and allow to cook for a few
minutes.

4. Add liquid

Add the bacon to the pot along with the red wine and bay leaf. Add enough water to cover by at least 2-3 inches. Bring to boil, then lower to a simmer. Allow to simmer at least 2 hours, until liquid thickens and beans are firmed and cooked.
